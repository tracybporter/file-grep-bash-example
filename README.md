This came from a before 6:30 am before-my-first-cup-of-coffee conversation with my husband one morning. I add an explanation because if we'd discussed it later I hopefully would have suggested something other than a bash script. HOWEVER, grep executes quickly. Development and maintenance time probably completely offset this gain...but it is fun exercise.
